# ChaCha20-Encryption-Implementation-in-Python

AES has become the gold standard for encryption, and will hopefully remain robust in a world of quantum computers.<br>
But what if someone finds a vulnerability in it?<br>
And surely it is rather complex for simple IoT devices to implement?<br>

ChaCha20 takes a 256-bit key and a 32-bit nonce and then creates a key stream, which is then XORed with the plaintext stream.<br>
In software, it is three times faster than AES, and is well suited to lower-powered devices and in real time communications.<br>

Thus AES isnâ€™t the only show in town.<br>
A large scale vulnerability on AES would cause much of the secure Internet to be exposed, thus it calls for an alternative.<br>
